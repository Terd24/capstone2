# ‚úÖ Export to CSV Before Delete Feature

## What's New:

Instead of just deleting data, the system now:
1. **Exports data to CSV file** (Excel-compatible)
2. **Then deletes from database**
3. **Shows export filename** in success message

## How It Works:

### Clear Attendance Records:
1. Select date range
2. Click "Clear Attendance Records"
3. System exports all records to CSV file
4. Then deletes from database
5. Success message shows:
   - Number of records deleted
   - Export filename
   - File location

### Clear Login Logs:
1. Select date range
2. Click "Clear Login Logs"
3. System exports all records to CSV file
4. Then deletes from database
5. Success message shows:
   - Number of records deleted
   - Export filename
   - File location

## File Locations:

### Attendance Records:
```
exports/attendance/attendance_export_2024-01-01_to_2024-12-31_2025-10-11_15-30-45.csv
```

### Login Logs:
```
exports/login_logs/login_logs_2024-01-01_to_2024-12-31_2025-10-11_15-30-45.csv
```

## File Format:

## Benefits:

3. Click "Clear Attendance Records" or "Clear Login Logs"
4. Check the success message for export filename
5. Go to the exports folder to find your CSV file
