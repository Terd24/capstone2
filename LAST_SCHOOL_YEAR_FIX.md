# Last School Year Validation Fix ✅

## Problem

Error message "Last school year is required" appears even when the field is filled.

## Root Cause

The JavaScript validation was looking for the wrong element type:

```javascript
// WRONG - Looking for input element
const lastSchoolYear = document.querySelector('input[name="last_school_year"]')?.value.trim() || '';
```

But the field is actually a `<select>` dropdown, not an `<input>`:

```html
<select name="last_school_year" ...>
  <option value="2024-2025">2024-2025</option>
</select>
```

**Result:** JavaScript couldn't find the field, so `lastSchoolYear` was always empty, triggering the validation error.

## Solution

Changed the selector from `input` to `select`:

```javascript
// CORRECT - Looking for select element
const lastSchoolYear = document.querySelector('select[name="last_school_year"]')?.value.trim() || '';
```

## Why This Happened

The field type mismatch:
- **HTML:** `<select name="last_school_year">`
- **JavaScript:** Looking for `<input name="last_school_year">`
- **querySelector returns:** `null` (element not found)
- **Value becomes:** Empty string `''`
- **Validation fails:** "Last school year is required"

## The Fix

### Before:
```javascript
const lastSchoolYear = document.querySelector('input[name="last_school_year"]')?.value.trim() || '';
// Returns: '' (empty) because input doesn't exist
```

### After:
```javascript
const lastSchoolYear = document.querySelector('select[name="last_school_year"]')?.value.trim() || '';
// Returns: '2024-2025' (actual value from select)
```

## Related Issues Fixed

This was part of a larger issue where:
1. ✅ Disabled fields don't submit (fixed with enable before submit)
2. ✅ Wrong selector type (fixed by changing input → select)
3. ✅ Both issues combined caused the error

## Result

✅ Correct element selector (select instead of input)
✅ Field value is properly retrieved
✅ Validation passes when field is filled
✅ No false error messages
✅ Form submits successfully
