ARCHIVE SYSTEM - HOSTINGER SETUP GUIDE
========================================

STEP 1: Upload Files
--------------------
Make sure these files are uploaded to your Hostinger:
✓ AdminF/setup_archive_system.php
✓ AdminF/archive_record.php
✓ AdminF/restore_record.php
✓ AdminF/get_archived_records.php
✓ AdminF/SuperAdminDashboard.php

STEP 2: Run Setup Script (ONE TIME ONLY)
-----------------------------------------
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: https://yourdomain.com/AdminF/setup_archive_system.php
3. Login as Super Admin
4. The script will create 3 tables:
   - archived_students
   - archived_employees
   - archive_log

STEP 3: Verify Setup
--------------------
Check in phpMyAdmin that these 3 tables exist:
✓ archived_students (should have columns: archive_id, original_id, lrn, first_name, last_name, father_name, mother_name, guardian_name, etc.)
✓ archived_employees (should have columns: archive_id, original_id, id_number, first_name, last_name, position, etc.)
✓ archive_log (should have columns: log_id, record_type, record_id, action, performed_by, etc.)

STEP 4: Test Archive System
----------------------------
1. Go to Super Admin Dashboard
2. Navigate to "Deleted Items"
3. Try to restore a deleted record (should work)
4. Try to archive a deleted record (should work)
5. Navigate to "View Archives"
6. Check if archived records appear

STEP 5: Delete Setup File (Optional)
-------------------------------------
After successful setup, you can delete:
- AdminF/setup_archive_system.php (no longer needed)

========================================
ESSENTIAL FILES FOR ARCHIVE SYSTEM
========================================

Core Files (DO NOT DELETE):
- archive_record.php - Archives deleted records
- restore_record.php - Restores deleted records
- get_archived_records.php - Fetches archived data
- SuperAdminDashboard.php - Main dashboard

Database Tables (DO NOT DELETE):
- archived_students - Stores archived student records
- archived_employees - Stores archived employee records
- archive_log - Tracks all archive actions

========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

If archive fails:
1. Check database connection in db_conn.php
2. Verify tables exist in phpMyAdmin
3. Check PHP error logs
4. Ensure Super Admin is logged in

If counts don't update:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check JavaScript console for errors
3. Verify get_archived_records.php is accessible
