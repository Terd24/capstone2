# Deleted Accounts Export System

## Overview
This system replaces permanent deletion with file export functionality, allowing Super Admins to save deleted account information to files instead of permanently removing them from the system.

## Features

### 1. Export to File Instead of Permanent Deletion
- **Student Accounts**: Exports complete student information including grades, fees, and payment history
- **Employee Accounts**: Exports employee information including attendance records and system account details
- **Comprehensive Data**: All related records are included in the export file

### 2. File Format
- **Format**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- **Structure**: Well-formatted with proper indentation for readability
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 with Unicode support
- **Naming**: `DELETED_[TYPE]_[ID]_[NAME]_[TIMESTAMP].json`

### 3. Export Contents

#### Student Export Includes:
- Complete student account information
- Parent account details
- All grades records
- Fee items and balances
- Payment history
- Export metadata (date, exported by, etc.)

#### Employee Export Includes:
- Complete employee information
- System account details (username, role)
- Attendance records
- Export metadata

### 4. Security Features
- **Access Control**: Only Super Admin can export files
- **Audit Logging**: All exports are logged in system_logs table
- **Data Validation**: Validates account existence and deletion status
- **Safe File Handling**: Prevents directory traversal and ensures secure file operations

## Usage Instructions

### For Super Admins:
1. Navigate to **Super Admin Dashboard** â†’ **Deleted Items**
2. Find the deleted account you want to export
3. Click the **"Export to File"** button (blue button)
4. Confirm the export in the dialog box
5. The file will automatically download to your computer
6. The account remains in the deleted items list for potential restoration

### File Storage:
- **Server Copy**: Files are saved to `/exports/deleted_accounts/` directory
- **Download Copy**: Files are automatically downloaded to your computer
- **Backup**: Both copies serve as backup for the deleted account data

## File Structure Example
