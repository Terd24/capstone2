# Approval System Changes

## Summary
Updated the approval system to only require Owner approval for **DELETE operations**, while **ADD operations** execute immediately.

## Changes Made

### 1. Add HR Employee (AdminF/add_hr_employee.php)
- **Before**: Required Owner approval before adding employee
- **After**: Adds employee immediately to database
- **Benefit**: Faster onboarding, no delays for new hires

### 2. Delete HR Employee (AdminF/delete_hr_employee.php)
- **Status**: Still requires Owner approval (unchanged)
- **Reason**: Deletion is permanent and high-risk
- **Process**: Creates approval request → Owner reviews → Executes on approval

### 3. Owner Dashboard (OwnerF/Dashboard.php)
- Kept both `add_hr_employee` and `delete_hr_employee` cases in approval execution
- This allows processing any old pending add requests
- New add requests won't be created, but system can handle legacy ones

## Current Workflow

### Adding HR Employee:
1. Super Admin fills out form
2. ✅ Employee added immediately
3. ✅ Account created immediately
4. ✅ Success message shown

### Deleting HR Employee:
1. Super Admin clicks delete
2. ⏳ Approval request sent to Owner
3. ⏳ Owner reviews in "Approval Requests" section
4. ✅ Owner approves/rejects
5. ✅ Action executed on approval

## Benefits
- ✅ Faster employee onboarding
- ✅ No bottleneck for routine additions
- ✅ Critical deletions still protected
- ✅ Owner maintains control over permanent changes
- ✅ Reduced approval queue clutter
