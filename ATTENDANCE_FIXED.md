# âœ… Attendance Table Fixed!

## What Was Wrong:
- The table name is `attendance_record` not `attendance`
- I was checking for the wrong table name

## What I Fixed:

### 1. clear_attendance_records.php
- Changed table name from `attendance` to `attendance_record`
- Now it will find and clear your attendance records

### 2. update_configuration.php
- Completely rewrote with different approach
- Used `ob_end_clean()` and `die()` for cleaner output
- Should fix the JSON error

---

## ðŸš€ Test Now:

Go to: `http://localhost/onecci/AdminF/direct_test.php`

1. Click "Test Update Config" â†’ Should see clean JSON âœ…
2. Click "Test Clear Attendance" â†’ Should see records deleted âœ…

---

## Expected Results:

### Update Config:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Updated",
  "maintenance_mode": "enabled"
}
```

### Clear Attendance:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Cleared successfully",
  "records_deleted": 5
}
```
(The number will be how many records were in your date range)

---

## What It Does Now:

âœ… Looks for `attendance_record` table (correct name)
âœ… Finds the date column automatically
âœ… Counts records before deleting
âœ… Deletes records in your date range
âœ… Shows how many were deleted

---

## Test in Dashboard:

After testing in direct_test.php, go to:
`http://localhost/onecci/AdminF/SuperAdminDashboard.php#system-maintenance`

Try the "Clear Attendance Records" button with today's date!
