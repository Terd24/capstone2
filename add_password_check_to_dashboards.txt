Add this code to the top of each employee dashboard (after session_start and before any other checks):

// Check if employee must change password (first-time login)
if (isset($_SESSION['must_change_password']) && $_SESSION['must_change_password'] === true) {
    header("Location: ../EmployeePortal/change_password.php");
    exit;
}

Files to update:
1. âœ… RegistrarF/RegistrarDashboard.php (DONE)
2. CashierF/Dashboard.php
3. GuidanceF/GuidanceDashboard.php
4. AttendanceF/Dashboard.php
5. HRF/Dashboard.php
6. EmployeePortal/AttendanceRecords.php (for teachers)

This prevents employees from accessing their dashboard without changing password first.
